1 Introduction
Diabetic retinopathy is a common and serious diabetes-related eye complications. It can cause vision loss and
blindness if left untreated. An ophthalmologist or eye doctor can check for this as a part of a dilated eye exam,
i.e. by dilating the pupils and checking the eyes for it. Anyone with any kind of diabetes can get diabetic
retinopathy. This complication occurs when high blood sugar due to diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels
in our eyes, mainly the blood vessels in the retina. The retina is highly sensitive to light and contains millions
of cells (also known as rods and cones). These cells capture light and send the visual information to your brain
through the optic nerve, giving us the ability to see. Vision loss or blindness is caused by effects of glucose
blocking blood vessels. This can lead to blood vessels in the retina to leak fluid or haemorrhage (bleed) and
distorting vision. In advanced cases, our eyes may proliferate with new abnormal blood vessels which could lead
these vessels to leak, scarring or cell loss in the retina.
