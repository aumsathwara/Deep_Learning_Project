1 Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy is a common and serious diabetes-related eye complications. It can cause vision loss and blindness if left untreated. An ophthalmologist or eye doctor can check for this as a part of a dilated eye exam, i.e. by dilating the pupils and checking the eyes for it. Anyone with any kind of diabetes can get diabetic retinopathy. This complication occurs when high blood sugar due to diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels in our eyes, mainly the blood vessels in the retina. The retina is highly sensitive to light and contains millions of cells (also known as rods and cones). These cells capture light and send the visual information to your brain through the optic nerve, giving us the ability to see. Vision loss or blindness is caused by effects of glucose blocking blood vessels. This can lead to blood vessels in the retina to leak fluid or haemorrhage (bleed) and distorting vision. In advanced cases, our eyes may proliferate with new abnormal blood vessels which could lead these vessels to leak, scarring or cell loss in the retina.

There are four stages of retinopathy.

• 1 - Mild nonproliferative retinopathy.
In this stage, Balloonlike swelling occurs in the retina’s tiny blood vessels, called microaneurysms. These microaneurysms may leak fluid into the retina.

• 2 - Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy.
In this stage, more blood vessels may swell and distort resulting in blood flow restriction thus blood vessels may lose the ability to carry fresh blood to keep the retina healthy.

• 3 - Severe nonproliferative retinopathy
In this stage, a significant portion of the blood vessels have been damaged. The fluid leakage releases growth factors into the retina causing new abnormal blood vessels to falsely grow.

• 4 - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).
In this stage, due to the growth factors, abnormal blood vessels grow along the inside surface of the retina, which are fragile and prone to bleeding and fluid leakage. The repeated swelling of these unhealthy cells in the retina can lead to the formation of scar tissue over time. If left untreated it can cause retinal detachment. i.e. the retina pulls away from the underlying tissue of the eye
